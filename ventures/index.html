<!-- ABOUT THIS PAGE
The pagedocs variable on this page tells Jekyll not to render the HTML comments below on our actual website.

Howdy! You're probably here looking to update the ventures on this page. It's super easy to get it done, but unfortunately it's not done here ;). You'll need a couple of things before you can update the ventures page, they are:

[Required]
1. The venture logo (this is a must), the venture will not display without a logo.
2. A short description (this is also a must).
[Optional]
3. The status of the venture - this can be either "Active" "Grad" or "Exit" which render as nothing, Alumnus, and Exited respectively on the ventures page.
4. Venture website - this will make the logo clickable & add the external link icon.
5. Twitter handle, facebook url - this will add the respective icons. NOTE: The twitter handle must be @handle and NOT the url. The facebook url MUST be a url (e.g. @venture, https://facebook.com/venture).
6. Brag - this is a short little brag about the venture. We don't currently use this in the design on the website, so it won't display.
7. Team Members - we don't currently use these in the theme either, but it would be wise to include them.

## UPDATING VENTURES
#### Notes about the venture logo
The venture logo MUST be in the svg file format and named in the following convention: logo_venture.svg
The venture logo will not display correctly if the SVG is not in the correct proportions, to make sure of this open the svg in illustrator or another vector program & change the artboard size to 200px x 150px. Then resize the logo to fit in this space & re-save the logo.
#### Updating the ventures
Here's where we get to the section about them not being on this page.
Venture information is stored in a csv file called ventures.csv located in the _data subdirectory just under the site root.
Data is separated into the following categories: venture,image,status,team,website,description,brag,twitter,facebook.
When adding a new venture, just add a line to the bottom of this file and follow the conventions above.
For example, for a venture called Starbucks, with a logo file of logo_starbucks.svg we might use the following:
Starbucks,starbucks,Active,"John Doe, Jane Doe",https://starbucks.com,"A great coffee company",,@starbucks,https://facebook.com/starbucks
##### Note several things in that string above.
If there is more than one team member, enclose the entire string in quotes ""
Always enclose the description in quotes ""
If you don't have an optional variable, simply skip it and add a comma to indicate you are moving to the next variable. In the example above, we skipped adding a brag.
VERY IMPORTANT NOTE - There MUST be the requisite number of commas in each line within the ventures.csv file. If a comma is missing or there are too many, the website will fail to build.
To change ventures, just modify the variables for that venture & save.

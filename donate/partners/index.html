                    <p>Our partners are the organizations and people that keep us going; our community thanks you immensely for your support.</p>
                    <p>For large contributions, we have found that a direct bank transfer is the easiest method to process these contributions. The form on the right will allow you to securely complete a bank transfer through our donation, payments, and verification providers, Donorbox, Stripe, and Plaid respectively. Your bank account information is stored with Stripe for full PCI compliance.</p>
                    <p>Startup Shell is funded solely through donations. Your donation goes directly to providing the resources, space, and events needed for student-run companies to grow and expand.</p>

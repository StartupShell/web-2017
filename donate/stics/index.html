                    <img src="/assets/donate/stics_square.svg" align="right" width="150" /><p>Startup Shell has partnered with <a href="http://stics.umd.edu">Student-Initiated Courses</a> (STICs) @ UMD. STICs is a program that helps students design, develop, and teach for-credit courses at the university.

                    <p>Donations help passionate students share their knowledge with the rest of UMDâ€™s student body. These contributions create real impact for real students.</p>

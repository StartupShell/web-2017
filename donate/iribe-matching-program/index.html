                    <p>Brendan Iribe pledged $50,000 to Startup Shell in support of our mission and an additional $10,000 in matching funds for contributions raised during the 2017 and 2018 fiscal years.</p>
                    <p>We need you to help us reach this goal. We strive to provide resources to our ventures with the singular goal of helping them grow. Consider a recurring donation to help negate our operating expenses so we can commit more resources to our ventures.</p>
                    <p>Startup Shell is funded solely through donations. Your donation goes directly to providing the resources, space, and events needed for student-run companies to grow and expand.</p>
                    <p class="footnote">Startup Shell is a non-profit organization pursuant to Section 501(c)(3) of the United States Internal Revenue Code. Your donation to Startup Shell may qualify for an income tax deduction in accordance with Federal and/or State income tax laws. Please consult with your tax advisor to determine whether your donation is tax deductible in whole or in part. Nothing in the communication is intended to constitute legal or tax advice.</p>

<!-- ABOUT THIS PAGE
The pagedocs variable on this page tells Jekyll not to render the HTML comments below on our actual website.

This is a nifty little feature that you'll find pretty useful when Startup Shell has big news. This page has a list of press assets and displays a list of press releases.

#### About Press Releases
Press releases are stored in the _posts subdirectory.
The press release file must be in Markdown format (.md) and be named with the following convention:
YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-release.md
Each press release must have the required YAML front matter (those variables up there ^^ between the lines at the top of the page).
##### About the YAML front matter
Each press release contains the following YAML front matter:

layout: post
title:  "Really Cool and Awesome Press Release Title"
date:   2017-04-06 9:00:00 -0500
categories: press releases
presscontactname: "John Doe"
presscontactemail: "jdoe@startupshell.org"
presscontactphone: "(206) 673-2979 x0"
subtitle: "Really cool & awesome press release subtitle."

It's pretty self-expanatory how to populate those variables, but here's a couple things to note:
Jekyll will use the date specified here to determine the date of the post as it shows up on the website.
The categories variable will determine the url structure of the press release (e.g. the categories above "press releases" will format the url to be https://startupshell.org/press/releases/YYYY-MM-DD-press-release-name.html).
The press contact information changes who the contact is that is listed on the press release.

<h4>About the project - from <a href="https://eng.umd.edu/idea-factory">eng.umd.edu/idea-factory</a></h4>
  <p>Groundbreaking for the 60,000-square-foot addition to the Jeong H. Kim Engineering Building took place in fall 2018. Its unique spaces and labs will enable students, faculty, and staff to address 21st century challenges while also serving as venues to translate basic research into invention and invention into product.</p>
  <p>Because we recognize that creativity is organic, we are designing a building that is unconventional in every way. In fact, the IDEA Factory will be drastically different from any other building on campus. The building design will spark innovation, encouraging a collision of ideas across engineering as well as the arts, business and science. Its movable walls and shared spaces will promote dialogue between students, entrepreneurs and faculty who are working in diverse fields such as multimedia, robotics, transportation, rotorcraft, and quantum engineering. - E.A. Fernandez</p>

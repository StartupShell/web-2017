# shell-alumni-map

This project was made for Startup Shell, the student-run startup incubator
at the University of Maryland. Often, many current shellers visit other cities
in the United States (and the rest of the world), and so we want them to be able
to meet up with alumni to keep the shell community strong. 

Using Google Maps' API and tabletop.js, we pull information about alumni directly
from a google sheet, and then plot their information all over this graph. As 
more and more alumni add their names, more people will be added.

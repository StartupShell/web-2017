__COLLEGE PARK, Md.__ - In these devastating times, we mourn the loss of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and countless others who have lost their lives because of racial bias. We stand with those against racism in all forms and we recognize the fear and outrage that has been rightly provoked by these senseless killings and America’s history of racial prejudice. Today we speak up against all forms of racism, overt or subconscious.

Although it is violence against Black Americans which evoked recent protests, America’s deeply rooted history of racism extends far beyond forms of violence. We see discrimination in our criminal justice system, in the average net worth of our households, in our education systems, and in our healthcare system, where most recently the coronavirus has taken a disproportionate toll on Black and Brown communities.

We cannot act as if we all will be in a position to experience and fully understand the pain, fear, and despair of Black Americans. However, our better nature and common sense tells us that the lack of respect, care, and equality for every human life, fueled by racial bias, is unacceptable and will not be tolerated.

At <a href="https://bit.camp">Bitcamp</a>, <a href="https://gotechnica.org">Technica</a>, and <a href="https://startupshell.org">Startup Shell</a>, our mission has been to create inclusive spaces for young people to build technology that transform their communities and our world for the better. We are incredibly proud of our diversity and welcome people from all walks to life to both participate in and organize our events.

Together we must do more. We intend to draw on our diversity in order to make effective change in racial equity and in moving our collective humanity forward. We will continue to work with our community at the University of Maryland, the state of Maryland, the Entrepreneurship community, and Major League Hacking to raise awareness, fight against racial prejudice, and create a more just society for everyone.

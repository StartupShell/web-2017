__COLLEGE PARK, Md.__ - Startup Shell announced today the generous commitment of Brendan Iribe in the overall amount of $50,000. This generous gift of $25,000 immediately and $25,000 one year from now will support Startup Shellâ€™s general operating expenses, capital improvements, venture grants, and allow for Brendan to work closely with Startup Shell and its members, as well as the broader University of Maryland community towards advancing shared innovation and entrepreneurship objectives. Brendan has also committed to a 1:1 matching program of an additional $10,000 for funds raised by the end of this year (2017) and next year (2018).

Speaking on Startup Shell's impact, Iribe said "I'm impressed with all the progress you guys have made and believe in your future." This gift will allow Startup Shell to fund direct-to-venture grants for portfolio companies and additionally advance Startup Shell's goal to spur the development of an entrepreneurship pipeline in College Park, Md. Designed to promote the creation of student startups, this entrepreneurship pipline will bring together entrepreneurial resources on the University of Maryland campus and surrounding community in an effort to remove the barriers student startups face in the creation of their ventures.

__COLLEGE PARK, Md.__ - Startup Shell is proud to announce its induction into the Stripe Atlas Network of incubators and accelerators. Stripe Atlas is a new initiative launched by Stripe designed to eliminate barriers to startup creation surrounding the initial legal formation of business ventures. Stripe Atlas takes the hassle out of creating a business venture by filing the paperwork to create a Delaware C-Corporation, obtain an EIN from the IRS, and opening a bank account.

According to Stripe, "Starting a company can be needlessly complicated—lengthy paperwork, bank visits, legal complexity, numerous fees, and non-obvious decisions about what services to use. We built Atlas to make this easy: a tool to handle everything involved in establishing an internet business. It’s available to entrepreneurs everywhere." Startup Shell looks forward to a prosperous partnership with Stripe in this initiative.

Parties interested in using Stripe Atlas to form their business should contact Startup Shell via email at [hello@startupshell.org](mailto:hello@startupshell.org) for additional information or to request a referral.
